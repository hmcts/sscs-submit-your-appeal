This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"},"1096879":{"findings":[{"version":"6.26.0","paths":["babel-core>babel-traverse","babel-core>babel-template>babel-traverse","babel-core>babel-helpers>babel-template>babel-traverse"]}],"metadata":null,"vulnerable_versions":"<7.23.2","module_name":"babel-traverse","severity":"critical","github_advisory_id":"GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92","cves":["CVE-2023-45133"],"access":"public","patched_versions":"<0.0.0","cvss":{"score":9.4,"vectorString":"CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H"},"updated":"2024-04-04T14:26:11.000Z","recommendation":"None","cwe":["CWE-184","CWE-697"],"found_by":null,"deleted":null,"id":1096879,"references":"- https://github.com/babel/babel/security/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92\n- https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-45133\n- https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16033\n- https://github.com/babel/babel/commit/b13376b346946e3f62fc0848c1d2a23223314c82\n- https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v7.23.2\n- https://github.com/babel/babel/releases/tag/v8.0.0-alpha.4\n- https://www.debian.org/security/2023/dsa-5528\n- https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00026.html\n- https://babeljs.io/blog/2023/10/16/cve-2023-45133\n- https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92","created":"2023-10-16T13:55:36.000Z","reported_by":null,"title":"Babel vulnerable to arbitrary code execution when compiling specifically crafted malicious code","npm_advisory_id":null,"overview":"### Impact\n\nUsing Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or `path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods.\n\nKnown affected plugins are:\n- `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`\n- `@babel/preset-env` when using its [`useBuiltIns`](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) option\n- Any \"polyfill provider\" plugin that depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`\n\nNo other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-party plugins might be.\n\n**Users that only compile trusted code are not impacted.**\n\n### Patches\n\nThe vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`.\n\nBabel 6 does not receive security fixes anymore (see [Babel's security policy](https://github.com/babel/babel/security/policy)), hence there is no patch planned for `babel-traverse@6`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n- Upgrade `@babel/traverse` to v7.23.2 or higher.
