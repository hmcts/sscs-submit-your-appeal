However, the second line of the `checkValue` function wrongly checks the upper bound of the passed parameters, since the value of `b.cmp(q)` can only be `0`, `1` and `-1`, and it can never be greater than `q`. \n\nIn this way, although the values of `s` cannot be `0`, an attacker can achieve the same effect as zero by setting its value to `q`, and then send `(r, s) = (1, q)` to pass the verification of any public key.\n\n### Impact\nAll places in this project that involve DSA verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this vulnerability.\n\n\n### Fix PR:\nSince the temporary private fork was deleted, here's a webarchive of the PR discussion and diff pages: [PR webarchive.zip](https://github.com/browserify/browserify-sign/files/13172957/PR.webarchive.zip)\n","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x9w5-v3q2-3rhw"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":2,"high":2,"critical":0},"dependencies":863,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":863}}
