You can do this by deleting it from your package manager's lockfile and re-installing the dependencies. `@babel/core` >=7.23.2 will automatically pull in a non-vulnerable version.\n- If you cannot upgrade `@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned above, upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:\n  - `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/preset-env` v7.23.2\n  - `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3` v0.8.5\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0\n  - `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-67hx-6x53-jw92"}},"muted":[],"metadata":{"vulnerabilities":{"info":0,"low":0,"moderate":2,"high":0,"critical":6},"dependencies":863,"devDependencies":0,"optionalDependencies":0,"totalDependencies":863}}
