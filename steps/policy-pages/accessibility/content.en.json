    "para4": "“The Digital Accessibility Centre (DAC) user/technical team carried out an accessibility audit for HMCTS Submit  and Track an Appeal on the 4th June 2018. This document incorporates the findings regarding any accessibility barriers identified during the process. Numerous access issues were reported by both our automated testing tools and manual testing team, many of which were of a low priority.  There were also various instances of page elements that did not adhere to the Government Digital Services (GDS) design manual. The majority of issues were encountered by our screen reader analysts who were able to navigate many of the pages with only minor difficulties. Some pages however, included form elements that were difficult to understand and navigate because they did not include text that was visible to screen reader software.  For example, screen reader users were unable to access the date picker independently and therefore required assistance in order to indicate when they were unable to attend a hearing. In some instances, users are instructed to download a paper form in order to continue the process. Some users of assistive technology are not able to access non-HTML documents independently. The GDS design manual states that HTML must be used first, and PDF second if the content can't be reproduced in HTML.  They also provide guidance on creating accessible PDF documents. Session time-outs are present that may prohibit disabled users from using the service. Although users are informed that they will be timed out after 20 minutes of activity,this information was not obvious. The information that users had inputted prior to the time-out was not saved and re-established upon re-authentication. Although we appreciate that session time-outs are important for security, these must not prohibit users from using the service.”"
